1. to set the vector table. we set the start up PC. We use CSTACK$$Limit which will provide by the linker
to make the compiler happy. we use extern keyword and cast it to int.

2. for the handlers, we use the define in the tm4c_cmsis.h file.

3. We can use self define handler. It's better to use assert_failed instead of infinity loop to avoid freeze.

4. use #pragma to set alias to handler

5.use the __stackless keyword provide by IAR to avoid falling into hardfault handler again.

6. Add all handler support includes the intterrupt.
