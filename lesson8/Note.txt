Function is a reusable code.

during the function, in assambly, instead of branch, the function use BL to remember the line in R14, the R13(SP: stack pointer)
 remeber the stack. 

The stack is only growing to the top. eg. the stack use 0x20000ff8, then the counter in the function start with 0x2000ff4.

main is also a function.

the function can pass numbers and save in the R0 for the parameter in the function.
