Function is a reusable code.

during the function, in assambly, instead of branch, the function use BL to remember the line to return in R14(LR), BL itself is 4 byte

instead of most instructions are 2 byte.

the R13(SP: stack pointer) remeber the stack. 

The stack is only growing to the top. eg. the stack use 0x20000ff8, then the counter in the function start with 0x2000ff4.

when return, BX instruction is used. The LR remeber the odd number, which is weird, cause the return address should always be even.

the reason of that is because the least significant bit is used as instruction exchange bit. If == 1, use thumb instruction, if == 0 use

arm instruction, but the cortex-m doesn't support arm instruction, so it's always odd.

main is also a function. called leaf function.

The stacks holds the local variables and save the return address.

the function can pass numbers and save in the R0 for the parameter in the function. The local variable however save on the stack

which is same as SP.
