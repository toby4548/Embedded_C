1. For RTOS, we use sequencial architecture.

2. It's possible to switch between background loop. RTOS is able to do that automatically.

3.The manually change messed up the memory which is not good.

4. We construct stack for different thread to avoid mess up with memory, however, it may still mess with 
the register, so we add the fake register value for R4~R11(original preserved for function call)
