Structure- unit relative variables.

struct is the keyword to use structure.

struct Point {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
};

1. if the variable is defined, no struct name is needed.

struct {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
} pa, pb;

or..

struct Point{
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
}; //remember this column

struct Point pa, pb;

or...(**Recommended**)

typedef struct {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
} Point;

Point p1, p2;
