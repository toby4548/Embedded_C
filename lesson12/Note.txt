c99 support the stdint.h data type defined for different size embedded system.

The order of byte in the multi byte variable is reversed because ARM is the low-indian machine(eg. e4 e3 e2 e1).

the code use in 32 bit machine may overflow on the 16bit processor because the C program automatic promote. 
To solve it, manually cast 16 bit into 32 bit.
this also caused problem between unsigned and signed in 16 and 32 bit.
