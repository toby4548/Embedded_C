1. The example shows a race condition. The value is read but not write yet before interrupt occurs.
So the interrupt uses the previous value. A race condition kind of bug is one of the worst bug which is hard to be discovered.

2. 2 solutions are commonlly used to deal with race condition.
1..Mutual exclusion: make sure that only "one" piece of code access to the shared resources in particular of time.
2..Not share any resources: by using the already designed array provide by Ti. all the register are
seperated and eliminate the potential risk of race condition.
