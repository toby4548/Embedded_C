1. The code generated by ccs has problem with the handler, interrupt and not usable.
we fix it by replacing the file with from last lesson.

2. the startup code, linker code should be replace for gnu. the .stack section is now place 
in first section of the RAM which make it unharmable to other section even when stack
 overflow happens and can be caught by the hardfault handler. 

3. weak keyword means it can be replaced. the alias means if it's not defined, then the
alias will be used.naked means that no additional operation for the stack.
