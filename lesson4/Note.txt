Talk about blink LED
The process is much more complicate than arduino.
1. Find all the GPIO registers in the datasheet
2. Turn off clock gating(saving power) to use the GPIO
3. find the register and set GPIO to output
4. find the register and set GPIO output type to digital output
5. set the GPIO data to turn on the LED.
6. use while loop to simulate delay.
