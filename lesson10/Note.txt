Stackoverflow: the stack grows out of the memory address.
Assign a address out of the memory boundary may cause the main never return and finally cause stackoverflow.

originally the function using pass by value and will not change the argument. To change it, use pointer and pass the value.
all local variable go out of scope when function return. To solve it, use the static keyword.
static keyword will allocate parameter globally but not on stack.
